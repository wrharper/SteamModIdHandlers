These are just quick little ways to organize the modid's to use ASM for ARK and Dedicated Server manager for Conan Exiles for the time being.

Just copy them to the root folder by right clicking the game in steam and browsing to the path. Put the file directly in that path.
Example:
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\ARK
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Conan Exiles
